- [X] Fix deletes on Many-to-Many relations
    - Eg: deleting a category doesn't work if any entries are using it, ideally we should just remove the categories
      from the entry (delete the join from the joining table)
    - Note: also fixed in-memory updates on the UI after category deletion and edit
- [X] Invalidate ALL data from the UI when logout or force logout happens
- [X] Integrate UI with SSE
- [X] Update chat category cache when category added/edited, etc.
    - Note: I will just pull from db
- [ ] Test SSE (Simple tests, multiple tabs, etc.)
- [ ] Test all @Transactional touch points
- [ ] Implement SSE state signal on the UI (Inside the chat or in the header)
- [ ] Implement reset and refresh chat button on the UI
